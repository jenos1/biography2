			<p> 
				I come from the Midwest, and moved to New England after college. I attended graduate school at the University of New Hampshire for a career as a speech pathologist. Later I became interested in computer technology and worked for many years in software quality assurance. <br> <br>

				I have a musical side, and have played fiddle -- mostly bluegrass and old time music -- for over ten years. I also have two Border Terriers, and enjoy showing them in AKC conformation as well as in Earthdog trials.
